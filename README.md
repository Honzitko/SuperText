# SuperText Highlighter

A WordPress admin demo that showcases gradient-driven text highlighting with optional word highlights and text shadows. Install it like any other plugin to access an interactive playground directly inside the dashboard.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository into a folder named `supertext-highlighter` inside your WordPress site's `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. From the WordPress dashboard, go to **Plugins â†’ Installed Plugins** and activate **SuperText Highlighter**.

## Usage

After activation a **SuperText Highlighter** item appears in the left-hand admin menu. Open it to:

- Toggle gradient highlighting on and off, including linear, radial, and conic gradients.
- Switch between six presets or supply your own custom color stops.
- Highlight comma-separated words or phrases with a configurable color.
- Enable a customizable text shadow that respects CSS custom properties.

All changes are applied live in the preview panel so you can experiment before copying the generated styles into your own projects.
